NOTICE:

The neighborhood_generation scripts are original from Riccardo Guidotti (see https://github.com/riccotti/LORE):

- neighbor_generator.py

    Adapted to generate datasets for two binary black-box classifiers.

- distance_functions.py

- gpdatagenerator.py

    Adapted to be able to generate unique prototype datasets and possibility for setting generating-steps to generate more unique data.

- util.py and prepare_dataset.py

    Some necessary functions are used in the data.preprocess_data.py and helper.py script.
